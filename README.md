GLOBAL AI HUB - KOC HOLDING DEEP LEARNING BOOTCAMP

Project Team

In this project, we prepared a project on the classification of sounds heard in cities using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset. Our objective in this project was to prepare an artificial intelligence model using deep learning algorithms. We downloaded the spectrograms semi-prepared from the audio files and processed it with gray_scale, normalization and resize. We saved those image arrays with their labels and accordingly we created X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test and y_test datasets and save them. Then we will prepare the CNN model by preprocessing these images and train this model.
